# Computational Chemist Specializing in Machine-Learned Interatomic Potential Models

Hello there! 

I'm a computational chemist with expertise in machine-learned interatomic potential models. 
My work focuses on implementing AI solutions to challenging problems in chemistry, particularly in ensemble-based uncertainty, the atomic behavior of neural network potentials, and their applications in large-scale molecular simulations and reaction pathway discovery.
